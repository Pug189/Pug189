# Hey, I'm Pug.

 I am a game dev that thinks that a game's community should have a say in how a game is made, and that polls should be held so everyone has an opinion no matter the scale.

## What I'm up to

I'm working on a game called [Mind Exchange](https://pug189.github.io/). It is currently in beta and doesn't have much, but there is a [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/gAk3Rnu) if you want to keep up with progress on updates.

## Lessons

I give coding lessons for HTML, CSS, and JS free of charge, although keep in mind I am no professional and I can't teach you everything there is to know. I teach the basics, enough to make a game.
