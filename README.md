# Hey, I'm Pug.

 I am a game dev that thinks that a game's community should have a say in how the game is made, and that polls should be held so everyone has an opinion no matter the scale.

## What I'm up to

I'm working on a game called Project Osiris. It is currently in development and the majority is still in concept form.
